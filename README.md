# ReFuseJS
An open source NodeJS-based comms library compatible with Fender FUSE devices.

## Work In Progress

This software is very much a work-in-progress at the moment. Usually, with anything I'm considering releasing open source, I wouldn't put my code online until it was at least functioning, but also relatively tidy. This time I decided to put up the code from day one while I'm still experimenting with how to communicate with FUSE devices, and still figuring out how I'm going to structure the code.

This basically means, it's a huge mess at the moment - and it doesn't really do anything useful yet. However, if you plug in a Fender Super Champ X2 to your PC via a USB cable and run index.js through Node, you should (hopefully) see your computer exchange a bunch of data with the Super Champ. If it does, then it means we're getting somewhere. The aim is that some day, you'll be able to control every feature of the amp via NodeJS, with (most likely) a browser-based front-end to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
